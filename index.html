<p>Vimly is a new way of learning and reading the official Vim Manual. There are
no ads, no third-party tracking scripts and it is not required a login. You are
ready to get full content only with your email.</p>

<p><b>Motivation</b>: We all love official manuals and it is needless to say
that each expert must RTFM. However, too often, we are too lazy to read an
entire manual from the beginning to the end. There is a solution to this
problem! Read it one chunk at a time. Reading a bit of it in the bathroom, in a
queue, before sleeping and each time we have a small slot of time. </p>

<p>We must remember what ancients have always said:</p>
<blockquote class="margin-xs" cite="Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu">
  <i>A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.</i>
</blockquote>
