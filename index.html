<p>Vimly is a new way of learning and reading the official Vim Manual. There are
<b>no ads, no third-party tracking scripts and it is not required a login</b>.</p>

<p><b>Motivation</b>: There are so much awesomeness behind VIM that you could
not even imagine. Before install thousand of plugin, patch your vimrc and
searching on the web about how to start (or close), <strong>READ THE
  MANUAL.</strong></p>

<p>I know, laziness is on the corner, a whole manual???</p>

<p>Here <b>vimly</b> comes in handy! Read it one chunk at a time.</p>

<blockquote class="margin-xs" cite="Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu">
  <i>A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.</i>
</blockquote>
