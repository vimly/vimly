******************************
Vi IMproved's Learning Session
******************************

`VIM <http://www.vim.org/>`_'s help file is the main source of knowledge about
VIM and his functionalities. This newsletter let you definitely learn this
**awesome text-editor** throughout *daily* or *weekly* email. Each email has a
theory section and a practice one. Even if you are an advance VIM user, I am
sure you will find useful exercises, tips and you will improve your knowledge.
**Join us end enjoy your new way of learning!**

Subscribers receive emails with:

- **Theory**: a portion of the official manual (help file);
- **Practice**: questions to enhance memorization and improve the learning
  process.
- **Help**: answers to questions.

See an `email preview </static/example.html>`_!

What motivate me to create this service:

- avoid users from reinventing the wheel. Write plugins for functionalities
  already covered in the core software is time wasted;
- spread helpful knowledge to every user from beginner to advanced;
- support Vim;
- You definitely **MUST** try it! I know.
